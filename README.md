# Graph-Delta-Stepping-SSSP
A python implementation of a graph algorithm for solving the single source shortest path problem called Delta Stepping Algorithm

This project has two main files:
+ deltaStepping.py
+ dijkstra.py

Both files are implementations of single source shortest path problem. Dijkstra'a algorithm was the original reference for solving single source shortest path problem but performed badly when it came to parallelization. Delta Stepping is one of the variants which incorporates concepts of Bellman Ford's algorithm along with dijkstra's algorithm to get a better performance for parallelization.
